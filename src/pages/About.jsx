                <p className='tracking-[1px]'>At Habot Connect DMCC, we believe in empowering both parents and learning support providers. While parents use the platform to find the right support, it's equally important for providers to showcase their expertise. This project introduces a simplified, step-by-step profile wizard designed specifically for learning support providers to create detailed and engaging profiles. The goal is to make the onboarding experience intuitive and seamlessâ€”enabling providers to input diverse information such as bios, services offered, specializations, availability, and contact details. By streamlining this process, we ensure that providers can present their skills effectively and connect with the right families in need of their support.</p>
